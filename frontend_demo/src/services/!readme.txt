The "deprecated" folder contains obsolete, deprecated and legacy files. Files
  which are outof date and/or no longer in use, simply being stored for future
  reference.
  
The "middleware" folder contains all middleware files aside from the core
  file. The core file contains the fundamental networking code for the middle-
  ware, whereas all the other files in the "suites" folder are specialized for
  specific tasks which make use of the code in the core file.
  
The "utilities" folder is self explanatory. It holds utility functions which are
  frequently used throughout the middleware (and sometimes elsewhere). This saves
  the development team from having to repeatedly write out the same code.
